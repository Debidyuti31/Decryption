# Decryption

## What is Decryption?
Decryption is the process of converting encrypted or encoded information back to its original, readable form. Decryption will restore the information in a decrypted format, but it simply means reversing encryption - which is the process of securing data by converting it into a coded format for confidentiality purposes. Basically, decryption involves the use of a key or password to decode the encrypted information and restore it back to its understandable form.
